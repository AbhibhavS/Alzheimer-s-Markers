Machine learning for Gene Expression in different brain regions

Abstract

Alzheimerâ€™s disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder whose aetiology is
currently unknown. Although numerous studies have attempted to identify the genetic risk
factor(s) of AD, the interpretability and/or the prediction accuracies achieved by these studies
remained unsatisfactory, reducing their clinical significance. Here, we employ the ensemble of
random-forest and regularized regression model (LASSO) to the AD-associated microarray
datasets from four brain regions - Prefrontal cortex, Middle temporal gyrus, Hippocampus, and
Entorhinal cortex- to discover novel genetic biomarkers through a machine learning-based
feature-selection classification scheme. The proposed scheme unravel the most optimum
and biologically significant classifiers within each brain region, which achieved by far the
highest prediction accuracy of AD in 5-fold cross-validation (99% average). Interestingly,
along with the novel and prominent biomarkers including CORO1C, SLC25A46, RAE1,
ANKIB1, CRLF3, PDYN, numerous non-coding RNA genes were also observed as
discriminator, of which AK057435 and BC037880 are uncharacterized long non-coding RNA
genes.
